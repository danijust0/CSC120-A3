- What are your initial impressions of Java? 

My initial impression was that Java was horrifying. After a while of tinkering with it however I discovered that I knew what to do, just not how to say it. It really is similar to coding python, I just had to start learning how to articulate my ideas in a way that java understands. Now, my current impression of Java is that it is slightly less scary. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Object orientation works the same way, in fact it feels a bit easier in Java. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
